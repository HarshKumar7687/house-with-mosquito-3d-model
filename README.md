## Description

This project demonstrates how to craft and render a 3D scene in the browser, combining structural elements like a house with an animated character—a mosquito. It’s built using:

- **HTML & CSS** for page structure and styling  
- **[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)** for quick and responsive design  
- **[Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)** as the development and build tool  

Feel free to adapt, expand, or repurpose it as a learning example or as the foundation for a more complex 3D web project.
